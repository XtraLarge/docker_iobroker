# docker-iobroker
Docker image for ioBroker (http://iobroker.net) based on debian:latest (http://hub.docker.com/_/debian/)

This project creates a Docker image for running ioBroker in a Docker container. It is made for and tested on a Synology Disk Station 1515+ with DSM 6 and Docker-Package installed. But it should also work on other systems with Docker!<br>
Cause the container ist based on debian:latest, it acts nearly like a full virtual machine. That makes it possible to easily add some additional dependies for some ioBroker-Adapters.

## Installation & Usage

A detailed tutorial (german) can be found on my Website (https://buanet.de/2017/09/iobroker-unter-docker-auf-der-synology-diskstation/).<br>
For discussion and support please visit ioBroker-forum-thread (http://forum.iobroker.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5089) or use the comments section at the linked tutorial. Please do not contact me directly for any support-reasons. Every support-question should be answered in a public place. Thank you.
